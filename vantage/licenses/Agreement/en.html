    <h1>Software license agreements, Lenovo Software Privacy Statement, and Lenovo Limited
      Warranty</h1>
    <p>This document provides the Lenovo License Agreement, third-party software license
      agreements, the Lenovo Software Privacy Statement, and the Lenovo Limited
      Warranty for hardware products. Collectively, the Lenovo License Agreement and
      the third-party software license agreements apply to software preinstalled on a
      standard model computer. In some cases, such as custom models containing
      customer-provided images or software, some of the third-party software licenses
      might not apply to you.</p>
    <p>Lenovo may automatically download and install
      critical updates without providing notification to the user. Updates are
      classified as critical when they are needed for the computer to function
      properly. Failure to install critical updates could result in data corruption
      or loss, a major system malfunction, or a hardware failure. For example,
      critical updates could include an update to the hard-disk-drive firmware, a
      BIOS upgrade, a device-driver fix, or a fix for the operating system or other
      preinstalled software. The user can turn off the automatic download and
      installation of critical updates by changing the default settings of the
      program after the initial setup.</p>

    <h2><a id="LLA">Lenovo License Agreement</a></h2>
    <p><b>L505-0009-06-R 10/2015</b></p>
    <p><b>This
        Lenovo License Agreement (the "Agreement") applies to each Lenovo Software
        Product that You acquire, whether it is preinstalled on or included with a
        Lenovo hardware product, acquired separately, or downloaded by You from a
        Lenovo Web site or a third-party Web site approved by Lenovo. It also applies
        to any updates or patches to these Software Products. This license agreement
        does not apply to non-Lenovo software that's either preloaded on or downloaded
        to your product.</b> Also, certain Software Products developed by or for Lenovo in conjunction with a
      third party may be governed under separate terms. Therefore, for more
      information on non-Lenovo or co-developed Software Products, please review the
      license agreements or terms associated with those products. This Lenovo License Agreement is available in
      other languages at <u>https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht100141</u></p>
    <p><b>Lenovo will license the Software Product to You only if You accept this Agreement.
        You agree to the terms of this Agreement by clicking to accept it or by
        installing, downloading, or using the Software Product.</b></p>
    <p><b>If You do not agree to these terms, do not install, download, or use the Software
        Product(s).</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>If You acquired the Software Product(s) and paid a
          license fee, return the Software Product to the party from whom You acquired it
          to obtain a refund or a credit of the amount You paid.</b></li>
      <li><b>If You acquired the Software Product(s) preinstalled on
          or provided with a Lenovo hardware product, You may continue to use the
          hardware product, but not the Software Product(s) covered under this Agreement.
        </b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>"Software Product"</b>
      includes Lenovo computer software programs (whether preinstalled or provided
      separately) and related licensed materials such as documentation.</p>
    <p><b>"You"</b> and "<b>Your"</b>
      refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Entitlement</b></p>
    <p>
      You must maintain Your original dated sales transaction document, such as a
      receipt, invoice or similar document, as Your proof of Your right to use the
      Software Product. The transaction document specifies the usage level
      acquired.CIf no usage level is specified, You may install and use a single
      copy of the Software Product on a single hardware product. Your transaction
      document also provides evidence of Your eligibility for future upgrades, if
      any. For Software Products preinstalled on, included with, or distributed at
      no charge for use on a Lenovo hardware product, Your hardware product sales
      transaction document is also the proof of Your right to use the Software
      Product.</p>
    <p>
      <b>2. License</b></p>
    <p>
      The Software Product is owned by Lenovo or a Lenovo supplier, and is copyrighted
      and licensed, not sold. Lenovo grants You a nonexclusive license to use the
      Software Product when You lawfully acquire it. </p>
    <p>
      You may <b>a)</b> use the Software Product up to the level of use specified in Your
      transaction document and<b> b)</b> make and install copies, including a backup
      copy, to support such use. The terms of this Agreement apply to each copy You
      make. You may not remove or alter any copyright notices or legends of
      ownership.</p>
    <p>
      If You acquire the Software Product as a program upgrade, after You install the
      upgrade You may not use the Software Product from which You upgraded or
      transfer it to another party.</p>
    <p>
      You will ensure that anyone who uses the Software Product (accessed either locally
      or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms
      of this Agreement. </p>
    <p>
      You may not <b>a)</b> use, copy, modify, or distribute the
      Software Product except as provided in this Agreement or in any way that
      violates any applicable laws including but not limited to copyright laws; <b>b)</b>
      reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Software Product
      except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual
      waiver; or <b>c)</b> sublicense, rent, or lease the Software Product. </p>
    <p>
      Lenovo may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement.
      If Lenovo does so, You must destroy all copies of the Software Product.</p>
    <p>
      Lenovo uses the System Update program to update Software Products on your computer. By
      default, critical updates are downloaded and installed automatically. Updates
      are classified as critical when they are needed for the computer to function
      properly. Failure to install critical updates could result in data corruption
      or loss, a major system malfunction, or a hardware failure. For example,
      critical updates could include an update to the hard-disk-drive firmware, a
      BIOS upgrade, a device-driver fix, or a fix for the operating system or other
      preinstalled software. You can disable this automatic feature by changing the
      settings of the System Update program at any time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Transferability </b></p>
    <p>
      You may not transfer or assign the Software Product to any other party, except as
      permitted in this section.</p>
    <p>
      Preinstalled Software Products are licensed for use only on the Lenovo hardware product on
      which they are preinstalled or included with and may be transferred only with
      that Lenovo hardware product. They may not be transferred independent of the
      Lenovo hardware product.</p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Third Party Software Components and Products </b></p>
    <p>
      Some
      Lenovo Software Products and future updates and patches may contain third party
      components, which may include Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Environment. These
      third party components are provided to You under separate terms and conditions
      different from this Agreement, typically found in a separate license agreement
      or in a README (or similarly titled) file. The third party's license terms and
      use restrictions will solely govern the use of such components.</p>
    <p>
      Third Party Software Products provided by Lenovo may be governed by the terms of this
      Agreement but are usually licensed by the Third Party under its own terms and
      conditions. Third Party Software Products that are not licensed by Lenovo are
      subject solely to the terms of their accompanying license agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Software Product Specifications</b></p>
    <p>
      The Software Product specifications and specified operating environment information
      may be found in documentation accompanying the Software Product, if available,
      such as a README or similarly titled file, or otherwise published by Lenovo.</p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <b> Please review the Lenovo privacy policy statement (<u>https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/privacy/</u>)

        your product. Depending on your particular Lenovo device or software product,
        the Lenovo privacy statement (<u>https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/privacy/</u>)
        is located at the point of activation and set-up and/or via "Settings".</b></p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Charges </b></p>
    <p>
      Charges for the Software Product are based on the level of use acquired.</p>

      You acquired the Software Product. Additional charges may apply.</p>
    <p>
      If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on
      Lenovo's net income, upon the Software Product, then You agree to pay the
      amount specified or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for
      any personal property taxes for the Software Product from the date that You
      acquire it.</p>

        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
        TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR
        TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY. </b></p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Suppliers or publishers of non-Lenovo Software Products may provide their own warranties.</p>
    <p>
      Lenovo does not provide technical support, unless Lenovo specifies otherwise in
      writing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>9. Limitation of Liability</b></p>
    <p>
      Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on Lenovo's part or other liability, You
      may be entitled to recover damages from Lenovo. In each such instance,
      regardless of the basis on which You are entitled to claim damages from Lenovo
      (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract
      or tort claim), except and to the extent that liability cannot be waived or
      limited by applicable laws, Lenovo is liable for no more than the amount of
      actual direct damages suffered by You, up to the amount You paid for the
      Software Product. This limit does not apply to damages for bodily injury
      (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property
      for which Lenovo is required by law to be liable.</p>
    <p>
      This
      limit also applies to Lenovo's suppliers and resellers. It is the maximum for
      which Lenovo, its suppliers and resellers are collectively responsible.</p>
    <p>
      <b> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS LENOVO, ITS SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE
        FOLLOWING EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 1) THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST

      <b> 10. Consumer Rights</b></p>
    <p>
      Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be
      waived or limited by contract. You may have additional consumer rights under

      or notebook &ndash; through our software, including Lenovo pre-installed applications,
      as well as information you may choose to provide to us, such as by registering
      your device and creating a Lenovo ID. Please note that this privacy statement
      does not apply to non-Lenovo software on your device, such as Microsoft
      applications. Also, certain software developed by or for Lenovo in conjunction

      review the privacy statements associated with those applications. You can learn
      more about Lenovo's Web-site privacy practices by

    <p>
      <i>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy
        statement at any time. If we make a change to this privacy policy, we will make
        the new version and previous versions available on <u>https://www.lenovo.com</u> so
        that you can see when changes occurred and what they are.</i></p>
    <h3>What Information does Lenovo collect and how do we use it? </h3>
    <p>
      Lenovo uses information to keep your Lenovo products working
      at their best and help you make the most of them. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Keeping your Lenovo software up-to-date.</b> &nbsp;We're
        always working to provide updates that deliver new features and fix bugs. We
        collect and use information we need to keep your Lenovo software up to date. </li>
      <li>
        <b>Help improve Lenovo products and enhance device support.</b> &nbsp;We want
        to ensure your products, services, and software
        are always working at their best. We collect and use information to identify
        performance trends, prioritize bug fixes, develop new features, and
        troubleshoot issues you might be having with your Lenovo software. If you
        decide you'd like us to stop collecting information on how you use Lenovo
        applications, you can turn off Usage Statistics in the Settings menu of certain
        applications, or disable or uninstall certain applications.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Creating an anonymous user profile.</b>&nbsp;We
        may create a profile of your use of our products, services, and Web sites based
        on information we have collected from you and your Lenovo products. Lenovo will
        collect basic information about which applications, services, and offers you
        choose during system setup. In order to make your experience more useful and
        enjoyable, we may also collect information on how you use your Lenovo device
        (including components). This information is kept anonymous and is not
        associated with your personal information described below. We use the profile
        to provide services and support and to make improvements to our offerings.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Creating a Lenovo ID and registering
          your product.</b> &nbsp;We also collect information, including personal information,
        when you create your Lenovo ID and when you register your products with us.
        Your Lenovo ID will be one way in which Lenovo identifies you when you interact
        with our online services such as our ecommerce and e-support Web sites. Along
        with your Lenovo ID, we may collect and store additional information, such as
        your name (as provided by you), e-mail address, user language and
        region/county, machine type-model (the type of device you use), your device IP
        address, device ID, serial number, the date you registered your device, and
        operating-system activation data. Your Lenovo ID will not be associated with
        the anonymous software data discussed in the paragraph above. You may
        deactivate your Lenovo ID at any point.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Providing Lenovo software and device functionality.</b>
        &nbsp;Some Lenovo products and software applications need access to
        information in order to function. They may keep the information locally on your
        Lenovo products or they may transfer it to Lenovo or a third party. Lenovo will
        only access such information if you specifically choose to enable or use these
        functions. The Lenovo Settings application includes an interface in which you
        can change your data collection settings for many Lenovo applications. If you
        need instructions on how to uninstall applications, please consult the Lenovo
        Support site (<u>https://support.lenovo.com</u>).</li>
      <li>
        <b>E-mail Communications. </b> &nbsp;If
        you choose to receive e-mail from Lenovo, we will collect, store, and use your
        name and e-mail address to send you product support announcements and/or
        promotional messages. You can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link at the
        bottom of our promotional messages. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> What kind of third parties does Lenovo share information with? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We limit the sharing of information
        described in this privacy statement to certain types of third parties who help
        us use it for purposes to which you have agreed. These include:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Service providers who provide hosting,
          data analyses, and customer support functions.</li>
        <li>
          Lenovo affiliates who help provide
          functionality for Lenovo software and who help us use information as described
          in this privacy statement.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        In special circumstances, we may also
        share your information with others, including:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Law enforcement and other government
            agencies where legally required to do so.</li>
          <li>
            Other third parties helping us protect
            our rights, our users' rights, and the rights of others, such as during
            litigation.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      How does Lenovo store and protect information we've collected and shared?</h3>
    <p>
      We use standard technical and organizational safeguards when
      we transmit information from Lenovo products to our servers, when we store
      data, and when we share it with third parties. However, please remember that no
      data storage or transmission method can be guaranteed to be completely
      invulnerable, so you understand that you use Lenovo products at your own risk. </p>
    <p>
      Our products include features designed to help you protect
      the information you store on your Lenovo products. These may include solutions
      like encryption, password and PIN unlock, and remote control over your Lenovo
      products so you can locate, lock, and erase lost or stolen devices. You can
      learn more about available features by accessing your Lenovo products' Security
      settings. </p>
    <p>
      When we collect information described in this privacy
      statement, we will retain it on our servers as long as necessary to support the
      Lenovo products you are using and to comply with applicable laws and our own
      policies. We may transfer, use, and store information that the Lenovo product
      collects outside of the country from which it came. These places may include
      jurisdictions whose privacy laws do not provide equivalent protection to such
      laws in your home country. Wherever these activities occur, we take appropriate
      steps to treat your information securely and in accordance with this privacy
      statement, our terms of use, and applicable laws and regulations. Use of Lenovo
      products constitutes your specific consent to the transfer of information
      described in this privacy policy. </p>
    <h3>What about my child's privacy? </h3>
    <p>
      Lenovo products are intended for adults and children ages 13
      and up who have permission to use them from their parents or legal guardians.

      Device, or (d) if You obtained the rights to use the Software and Services as
      described in this License Agreement from a Symantec authorized service provider
      ("Service Provider") the date determined by such Service Provider. The Service
      Period shall last for the period of time set out in the Documentation or the
      applicable transaction documentation from the authorized distributor, reseller,
      or Service Provider from which You obtained the Software and Services. The
      Software and Services may automatically deactivate and become non-operational
      at the end of the Service Period, and You will not be entitled to receive any feature
      or content updates to the Software and Services unless the Service Period is
      renewed. Subscriptions for renewals of the Service Period will (i) be
      available in accordance with Symantec's support policy posted at <u>https://support.norton.com/sp/en/uk/home/current/solutions/v74023230_EndUserProfile_en_us</u>

      Software and Services that Symantec may make available to You. Except as may
      be modified by the Documentation, Your rights and obligations under this
      License Agreement with respect to the use of this Software and Services are as
      follows.</p>

      Service Period, You may: </p>
    <ol type="A">

        use one copy of the Software and Services on a single Device. If a greater
        number of copies and/or number of Devices is specified within the Documentation
        or the applicable transaction documentation from the authorized distributor,
        reseller, or Service Provider from which You obtained the Software and
        Services, You may use the Software and Services in accordance with such
        specifications; </li>
      <li>
        make one copy of the Software and Services for back-up or archival purposes,
        or copy the Software and Services onto the hard disk of Your Device and retain

For example, if the Documentation or the applicable transaction documentation from the authorized distributor, reseller, or Service Provider grants You the right to use multiple copies of the Software and Services or the right to install the Software and Services on multiple Devices, only a transfer of all the rights to use all such copies and Device installations of the Software and Services would be valid. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing rights to transfer do not apply if You obtained the Software and Services from Your Service Provider; and </li>
      <li>use the Software and Services in accordance with any additional permitted uses which may be set forth below. </li>

    <h3>11. Export Regulation: </h3>
    <p>You acknowledge that the Software and Services and related technical data and services (collectively "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported.

    <h3>12. Dispute Resolution: </h3>
    <p>Symantec believes that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting Symantec customer support. If You are a U.S. customer, and the dispute is not resolved through Symantec customer support, You and Symantec agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Software and Services or this License Agreement (a “Claim”), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, as follows: </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Small Claims Court: You may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute. You agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara. </li>
      <li>Arbitration: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to this License Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that You and Symantec are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this License Agreement and/or the termination of Your Symantec product license.</li>
      <br>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Notice of Claim: If You elect to seek arbitration, You must first send to Symantec, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim ("Notice of Claim"). The Notice of Claim to Symantec should be addressed to: General Counsel, Symantec, Inc., 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043 and should be prominently captioned “NOTICE OF CLAIM”. The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like Symantec to use to contact You. If Symantec elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to Your billing address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by You or by Symantec, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand"); and (c) whether You reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Symantec (see Section 12(B)(e)). </li>
        <li>Arbitration Proceedings: If You and Symantec do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, You or Symantec may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court). You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at https://www.adr.org. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this License Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at https://www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this License Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
          <p>
            Unless Symantec and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either Your residence or of the mailing address You provided in Your Notice of Claim. If Your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, Symantec agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of Symantec’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Symantec did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Symantec will pay You, in addition to the award, either U.S. $500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief: Except as set forth in Section 12(A), the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by You or Symantec, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that You or Symantec prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>
        <li>Arbitration Fees: If Your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Symantec will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including reimbursement of Your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in Your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If Your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees. </li>
        <li>Class Action Waiver:&nbsp; <b>YOU AND SYMANTEC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, if You have elected arbitration, unless both You and Symantec agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with Your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void. </li>
        <li>Modification of Dispute Resolution Section: Notwithstanding Section 2(A), if Symantec changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date You first accepted this License Agreement, and You have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, You may reject any such change by so stating within Your Notice of Claim. By failing to reject any changes to this Dispute Resolution section in Your Notice of Claim, You agree to resolve any Claim between You and Symantec in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of Your Notice of Claim. Current versions of license agreements for Symantec products can be found at <u>https://www.symantec.com/about/profile/policies/eulas/</u>. </li>
        <li>Severability: With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 12(B)(e) of this Agreement ("Class Action Waiver"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply.</li>
      </ol>

    <ol type="A">
      <li>Governing Law. This License Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America. </li>

    <p><b>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</b></p>
    <p><i>To Help Protect You</i></p>
    <p>When you install or use one of our Services, it will run in the background of your device or environment to help predict threats and better protect you, your devices, and your information.&nbsp; For example, McAfee may use information to:</p>

    </ul>
    <p><i>For Advertising Purposes</i></p>
    <p>We make a variety of products available to our customers at no charge. In order to keep these products free, we may use information collected through them, such as what websites you visit or the mobile applications you use, to allow McAfee and others to show you ads that are targeted to your interests. We do this by sharing an identifier assigned to your device, together with web browsing activity or application usage information, with select partners. This information does not identify you personally and we contractually prohibit the partners from using the information we provided to identify you. You can opt out of the use of your information for this purpose in the settings of the products that include this data sharing. For more information on which Services contain this feature and how to opt out, click <u>here</u>.</p>
    <p><b>Third-Party Advertising</b></p>
    <p>We work with third-party advertising companies to display or deliver ads to you while you are on our Site or using some Services. These third-party advertisers may collect data about your interaction with the Site or Services or others’ sites or services to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. See our <u>Cookie Notice</u> to learn more about how McAfee and these advertising partners use tracking technologies like cookies and the choices available to you.</p>

    <p><b>Other Uses</b></p>
    <p>We may use Personal Data for which we have a legitimate interest, such as direct marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Data or with your consent.</p>
    <p><b>Who Do We Share Personal Data With?</b></p>
    <p>Generally, we disclose the information we collect to provide the Services, to communicate with you, to advertise or promote our Services, to facilitate changes to or transfers of our business, as required by law, or with your consent.

      <li>To legal, governmental, or judicial authorities as instructed or required by those authorities and applicable laws, or in relation to a legal activity, such as in response to a subpoena or investigation of suspected illicit or illegal activities, or where we believe in good faith that users may be engaged in illicit or illegal activities, or where we are bound by contract or law to enable a customer or business partner to comply with applicable laws;</li>
      <li>In connection with, or during negotiations for, an acquisition, merger, asset sale, or other similar business transfer that involves all or substantially all of our assets or functions where Personal Data is transferred or shared as part of the business assets (provided that such party agrees to use or disclose such Personal Data consistent with this Notice or gains your consent for other uses or disclosures);</li>
      <li>With your consent or at your direction, such as when you choose to share information or publicly post content and reviews (for example, social media posts); and</li>
      <li>With persons of your choosing and at your discretion, should the product you are subscribed to allow that functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also share aggregate data that does not identify you or any specific device with third parties.</p>

    <p><b>How Do We Protect Your Data?</b></p>

    <p><b>What Choices Do You Have About Your Personal Data?</b></p>
    <p><i>McAfee Accounts</i></p>
    <p>If you register a McAfee Consumer Product, you can access and correct the Personal Data in your profile at any time by visiting <u>My Account</u> or contacting us as described below. If you have not registered a McAfee product but one of our products is installed on your device, you may stop McAfee’s collection of data from your device by uninstalling that product. To close your account and for other support questions, please visit the McAfee <u>Contact Us</u> page and click on Support.</p>

    <p><b>Children’s Privacy</b></p>
    <p>Some of McAfee’s Services provide security features that parents may use to monitor their child’s activity online, physical location, or use of a registered device. These Services require parental consent, and we do not knowingly use the Personal Data we collect from children’s devices for any purpose except to deliver the Services. These products allow parents to delete their child’s profile at any time. If you believe we have collected information from your child in error or have questions or concerns about our practices relating to children, please contact us as described below. If you are under the age of 18, you must have your parent’s permission to access the Services. McAfee urges parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without parental permission. If you learn that your child has provided us with Personal Data without your consent, you may alert us by contacting us as described below. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Data from children under 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.</p>
    <p><b>Residents of the European Economic Area</b></p>
    <p><i>Data Transfers</i></p>
    <p>McAfee is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations, entities, and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your Personal Data to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it. If you are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland through a series of intercompany agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under EU law. You are entitled to obtain a copy of these agreements by contacting us as described below.</p>

    <p>If you register a McAfee Consumer Product, you can access and correct the Personal Data in your profile at any time by visiting <u>My Account</u>. If you have not registered a McAfee product but one of our products is installed on your device, you may stop McAfee’s collection of data from your device by uninstalling that product.</p>
    <p>You may request access, changes to, or removal of your Personal Data in accordance with the applicable laws by contacting us as indicated below. For some requests and where permitted by law, an administrative fee may be charged. We will advise you of any applicable fee prior to performing your request.</p>
    <p>Although McAfee makes good faith efforts to provide customers with access to their Personal Data, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, where the information would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where it is commercially proprietary. If McAfee determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Data.</p>
    <p><i>For Corporate/Business Customers Only</i></p>
    <p>McAfee is a data processor and only processes Personal Data in line with instructions received from its customers.</p>
    <p>McAfee will act on written instructions received from Corporate Customers to access, delete, release, correct, or block access to Personal Data held in McAfee’s products and systems. Any requests relating to access, erasure, or rectification should be made by an authorized individual using the Individual Data Request Form available at <u>https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/about/legal/gdpr-data-request.html</u>. We will assist our Customers with requests from their employees in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.</p>

      <li>License Terms (Including Restrictions, Ownership, Changes, Termination and Privacy)</li>
      <li>Payment &amp; Support Terms (Including Automatic Renewal, Cancellation, Refunds, Support and Updates)</li>

      <li>McAfee Contact Information</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>LICENSE TERMS</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b>License Grant For Personal Use.</b> We are pleased to grant you, an individual consumer, a personal, non-transferable, nonexclusive term-limited license to install and use any Software and Services for which you have purchased a subscription for personal use on the number of devices and for the number of users specified in your License Entitlement or Service Entitlement, as applicable, subject to the System Requirements .</p>
    <p>"License Entitlement" means the number and type of devices and users that are permitted to use the Software, as specified in the documents that accompanied your purchase or download, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another document made available to you when you purchased the product. If no licensed device count or user count was specified, the License Entitlement is for a single device and user.</p>
    <p>"Service Entitlement" means the scope and duration of the Services you purchased, as specified in documents made available to you when you purchased the product. If no scope or duration is specified in the documents, the Service Entitlement is for a single device and user for one year.</p>
    <p>"System Requirements" means the supported devices and operating systems that the particular McAfee product will function properly with, as listed on our <u>website</u>. It is your responsibility to meet System Requirements, such as obtaining updates or upgrades in order to continue using the Software.</p>
    <p><b>License Grant for Small Business Use.</b>&nbsp; This license permits use of the Software only by personnel employed by the licensed small business entity. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to registration of the Software, we hereby grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software on the number of devices for which you have purchased subscription licenses as set forth in the documents that accompanied your purchase, provided that such use is only for the subscription term purchased by you, solely by personnel employed by you, and solely for internal business operations. (For the purpose of this Agreement, use of the Software means to access, install, download, copy or otherwise benefit from using the Software). You acknowledge that the Software and all related information are proprietary to us and our suppliers. You will be entitled to Updates which are made generally available by us for so long as you maintain your subscription. This license is revocable by us as provided in this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Your use of the Software is limited to devices and operating systems we support and may be affected by the performance and compatibility of your hardware, software and Internet access. Meeting system requirements is your responsibility and you are responsible for the cost of your equipment, which may include obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time in order to continue using the Software. System requirements are set forth on the product description page. (For purposes of this Agreement, product description page means either the webpage describing the product and/or the applicable product data sheet).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You must register each license to the Software that you purchase. Registration is required in order to obtain technical support, in order to claim any included Virus Removal Service session per year of annual subscription per purchased license, and so that any licenses that you purchase in the future will have the same renewal date as your initially purchased licenses. Unused sessions do not roll-over to the next subscription year. It is your obligation to ensure that someone within your organization has access to your registration account and the email address identified in the account profile in order to obtain support from us and to receive the pro-rata rate on additional license purchases described below.</p>
    <p>If you purchase additional licenses of the Software which you registered to your account in the future and you use the email address identified in your account profile for the new purchases, the initial term of the additional licenses will be automatically reduced so that the renewal date is the same as the renewal date of the Software licenses you initially purchased.&nbsp; In that event, you will be charged a prorated subscription price based on a calendar day basis for the reduced initial term. If you do not register your initial licenses to your account, or you do not use the email associated with the account during checkout, you will receive no pro-rata pricing and the subscription term of such additional licenses will be the term that you purchased.</p>
    <p>If the Agreement terminates for any reason or expires, neither you nor any personnel employed by you will be authorized to use or access the Software, including any online storage or backup services, and we may cancel and/or close your account at our sole discretion. After the termination or expiration date, we will follow our standard policies to delete any of your online stored or backed-up information, text, files, links, images or other materials provided to us ("Content"). It is your responsibility to store or backup your Content elsewhere before this Agreement expires or is terminated. Use of Software, at any time, is governed by the terms of this Agreement.</p>

    <p><b>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p>
    <p><b>For all non-European Union customers.</b></p>
    <p><b>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.</b> Subject only to the Small Claims Court Option described below in this section, any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy ("Claim") by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning the Agreement, the Software, or Services shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to: (i) Claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of this Agreement, including any of these arbitration provisions; (ii) Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy; (iii) Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assignees, employees, and agents; and (iv) Claims that could have been asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other collective, consolidated, or representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed solely on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis and the arbitrator shall have the authority to award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT. BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION OF ANY KIND.</p>
    <p><b>Notice of Dispute</b>. The party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating arbitration. When sent to us, notice should be sent to McAfee, 5000 Headquarters Drive, Plano, TX 75024, Attention: Legal Department. The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration. Notwithstanding these notice obligations, any demand for arbitration must be made by you or us within the statute of limitations that is applicable to the Claim(s) upon which arbitration is sought or required.&nbsp; These notice obligations do not modify the statute of limitations that is applicable to any Claim(s).</p>
    <p><b>Administration of Arbitration</b>. If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not state law. Subject only to the Small Claims Court Option for individual consumers described below, <b>YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</b> Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding will be confidential. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years’ experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as applicable, as modified by this Agreement (the "Arbitration Rules"). For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. Except with respect to any claims or counterclaims seeking less than $25,000, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English, and the United States FAA will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement. The award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law. You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award will determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.</p>
    <p><b>Costs</b>. The party initiating the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee. If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee. We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing. All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules. However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>
    <p><b>Small Claims Court Option.&nbsp; </b>If you are an individual consumer, you may choose to sue us in small claims court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California if you meet the court’s requirements.</p>
    <p><b>Right to Resort to Provisional Remedies Preserved by McAfee.</b> Nothing herein will be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction; provided, however, that we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.</p>
    <p><b>Conflicting Terms</b>. In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement will govern. If any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement; provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement will be null and void; and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement will be null and void as to such claims only. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement will control.</p>
    <p><b>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.&nbsp; &nbsp;IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. This paragraph in no way invalidates the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.</b></p>

    <p><b>GENERAL LEGAL TERMS</b></p>
    <p><b>Law Covering This Agreement.</b> Except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software and Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. If for any reason, the laws of the state of New York are found not to apply, then, except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software, Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to the Software or Services.</p>
    <p><b>Attacks on Data</b>. You acknowledge that some security breaches involve attacks on data. For example, there are viruses and other malware that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element); (ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation); and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption). The best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device or location. That way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data. Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted, destroyed, or modified data. We will have no liability for loss of or recovery of data, or files or loss of use of systems or networks arising from attacks on data.</p>
    <p><b>Limited Warranty.</b> For 30 days after the purchase date ("Warranty Period"), for paid versions of the Software only, we warrant that the Software licensed under this Agreement (including updates provided during the Warranty Period but not for updates provided outside of the Warranty Period) will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation provided by us in connection with that Software at the time of purchase, and that any tangible medium (such as a CD-ROM, but excluding devices manufactured by other companies) on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship. We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular mobile device or computer will be compatible with or function with the Software or Service, nor do we warrant or accept any liability for the operation of your personal equipment that is used to access the Software or Service. Your sole remedy, and our and our suppliers’ entire liability, in case of any breach of this limited warranty is that we will, at our option, refund the price you paid for the license, replace the defective medium that contains the Software, re-perform the Service, or provide an alternative remedy as required by local consumer law in your jurisdiction. These remedies may not be available in some countries to the extent that we are subject to restrictions under applicable export-control laws and regulations. If the tangible medium is defective, you must return it at your expense to the place where you bought it and provide a copy of your receipt. Any replacement medium will be warranted for the remainder of the original Warranty Period.</p>
    <p>DISCLAIMER. THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES. THEY REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, TERMS OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, FOR INSTALLING AND USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE, AND FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED. WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE SOFTWARE’S OR SERVICE’S USE OR PERFORMANCE. WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE’S OR SERVICE’S OPERATION WILL BE FAILSAFE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE FROM ERRORS OR DEFECTS, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL PROTECT AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS (INCLUDING INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT BY THIRD PARTIES), THAT THERE WILL BE NO MALFUNCTIONS OR OTHER ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES CAUSED BY VIRUS, INFECTION, WORM OR SIMILAR MALICIOUS CODE NOT INTRODUCED OR DEVELOPED BY US, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DOWNTIME OR SERVICE INTERRUPTION, FOR ANY LOST OR STOLEN DATA OR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACTIONS OR INTRUSIONS.</p>
    <p><b>High Risk Activities.</b> The Software and Services are not fault-tolerant and are not designed or intended for high-risk activities such as use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance, including nuclear-facilities operations, air traffic communication systems, weapons systems, direct life-support machines, or any other application in which the failure of the Software or Services could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or property damage. We expressly disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for high-risk activities.</p>
    <p><b>Limitation of Liability</b>. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY: (I) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (II) THEFT OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, AND (III) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF PERSONNEL SALARIES, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR, OUR AFFILIATES’ OR OUR SUPPLIERS’, LICENSORS’ OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE, OR USD $100 (OR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN NATIONAL CURRENCY) IF YOU USED FREE SOFTWARE. You agree to the limitations of liability in this Section and acknowledge that without your agreement to this term, the fee charged for the Software would be higher. Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights you may have under existing consumer-protection statutes or other applicable laws that may not be waived by contract in your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p><b>Export Control</b>. The Software is subject to export controls under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and implementing regulations. You agree that you will not directly or indirectly export, transmit, permit access or use the Software or Services and its related documentation, including technical data, in any country to which export, transmission or access is restricted by regulation, statute, or other law, without any required authorization of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governmental entity that may have jurisdiction over export or transmission. Export to a particular individual, entity, or country may be prohibited by law. If McAfee receives notice that a user is or becomes identified as a sanctioned or restricted party under applicable law, McAfee will not be obligated to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement if such performance would result in violation of the sanctions or restrictions. Additional Information about restricted parties can be found at the following websites: <u>Consolidated Screening List</u> and <u>OFAC Sanctions Programs</u>.

Some third-party materials included with the Software or Services may be subject to other terms and conditions, which are typically found in a "Read Me" or an "About" file accompanying the Software or Services. Those third-party materials may include software source code licensed by third parties under one or more open-source or free-software licenses, including the GNU General Public License, which are considered "Open Source Software." The Open Source Software is licensed under terms and conditions different from this Agreement and may, in some cases, conflict with the terms of this Agreement and will apply instead of the terms of this Agreement. If an Open Source Software license requires us to distribute any source code related to the Software or Services or any modifications to the Software or Services, we will make the source code available on request.</p>
    <p><b>No Waiver</b>. We do not waive any provision of this Agreement unless we waive it in a signed writing.</p>
    <p><b>Severability</b>. If any part of this Agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, that part is, to that extent, deemed omitted, and the rest of it remains fully enforceable; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS AS TO WHICH THE LIMITATIONS ON CLASS ACTIONS OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION ARE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

    </p>
    <p><i>
        Lenovo warrants that each Lenovo hardware product that you
        purchase is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use
        during the warranty period. The warranty period
        for the product
        starts on the original date of purchase as shown on your sales receipt or
        invoice or as may be otherwise specified by Lenovo. The warranty period and
        type of warranty service that apply to your product are as specified in "<b>Part

          DURATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </i></b></p>
    <p><b><i><u> How to Obtain Warranty Service </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p><i>If the product does not function as warranted
        during the warranty period, you may obtain warranty service by contacting
        Lenovo or a Lenovo approved Service Provider. A list of approved Service
        Providers and their telephone numbers is available at: <u>https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/supportphonelist</u>.</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>Warranty service may not be
        available in all locations and may differ from location to location. Charges
        may apply outside a Service Provider's normal service area. Contact a local
        Service Provider for information specific to your location.</i>
    </p>
    <p><b><i><u>Customer Responsibilities for Warranty Service</u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        Before warranty
        service is provided, you must take the following steps: </i>
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li><i>follow the service request procedures specified by the
          Service Provider </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>backup or secure all programs and data contained in the
          product </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>provide the Service Provider with all system keys or
          passwords </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>provide the Service Provider with sufficient, free, and
          safe access to your facilities to perform service </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>remove all data, including confidential information,
          proprietary information and personal information, from the product or, if you
          are unable to remove any such information, modify the information to prevent
          its access by another party or so that it is not personal data under applicable
          law. The Service Provider shall not be responsible for the loss or disclosure
          of any data, including confidential information, proprietary information, or
          personal information, on a product returned or accessed for warranty service </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>remove all features, parts, options, alterations, and
          attachments not covered by the warranty </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>ensure that the product or part is free of any legal
          restrictions that prevent its replacement </i>
      </li>
      <li><i>if you are not the owner of a product or part, obtain
          authorization from the owner for the Service Provider to provide warranty
          service </i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i><u>
            What Your Service Provider Will Do to Correct Problems </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        When you contact a
        Service Provider, you must follow the specified problem determination and
        resolution procedures. </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        The Service Provider
        will attempt to diagnose and resolve your problem by telephone, e-mail or
        remote assistance. The Service Provider may direct you to download and install
        designated software updates. </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        Some
        problems may be resolved with a replacement part that you install yourself
        called a "Customer Replaceable Unit" or "CRU." If so, the Service Provider
        will ship the CRU to you for you to install. </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        If your problem cannot
        be resolved over the telephone; through the application of software updates or
        the installation of a CRU, the Service Provider will arrange for service under
        the type of warranty service designated for the product under "<b>Part 3 -
          Warranty Service Information</b>" below. </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        If the Service
        Provider determines that it is unable to repair your product, the Service
        Provider will replace it with one that is at least functionally equivalent. </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        If the Service Provider determines that it is
        unable to either repair or replace your product, your sole remedy under this
        Limited Warranty is to return the product to your place of purchase or to
        Lenovo for a refund of your purchase price. </i></p>
    <p><b><i><u> Replacement Products and Parts </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        When warranty service involves
        the replacement of a product or part, the replaced product or part becomes
        Lenovo's property and the replacement product or part becomes your property.
        Only unaltered Lenovo products and parts are eligible for replacement. The
        replacement product or part provided by Lenovo may not be new, but it will be
        in good working order and at least functionally equivalent to the original
        product or part. The replacement product or part shall be warranted for the
        balance of the period remaining on the original product. </i>
    </p>
    <p><b><i><u>Use of Personal Contact Information </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p><i>
        If you obtain service under this warranty,
        you authorize Lenovo to store, use and process information about your warranty
        service and your contact information, including name, phone numbers, address,
        and e-mail address. Lenovo may use this information to perform service under
        this warranty. We may contact you to inquire about your satisfaction with our
        warranty service or to notify you about any product recalls or safety issues.
        In accomplishing these purposes, you authorize Lenovo to transfer your
        information to any country where we do business and to provide it to entities
        acting on our behalf. We may also disclose it where required by law. Lenovo's

      <h3 class="warr">Part 3 - Warranty Service Information </h3>
    </div>
    <p>The warranty period may vary by country
      or region and is specified in the printed warranty documentation that came with
      your computer.
    </p>
    <p>If
      required, the Service Provider will provide repair or exchange service
      depending on the type of warranty service specified for your product and the
      available service. Scheduling of service will depend upon the time of your
      call, parts availability, and other factors.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>Types of Warranty Service </u></b>
    </p>
    <p><b>
        1. Customer Replaceable Unit ("CRU") Service</b>
    </p>
    <p>Under CRU Service, the Service Provider will
      ship CRUs to you at its cost for installation by you. CRU information and
      replacement instructions are shipped with your product and are available from
      Lenovo at any time upon request. CRUs that are easily installed by you are
      called "Self-service
      CRUs". "Optional-service CRUs "are CRUs that may require
      some technical skill and tools.
      Installation of Self-service CRUs is your
      responsibility. You may request that a Service Provider install
      Optional-service CRUs under one of the other types of warranty service
      designated for your product. An optional service offering may be available for
      purchase from a Service Provider or Lenovo under which Self-service CRUs would
      be installed for you. You may find a list of CRUs and their designation in the
      publication that was shipped with your product or at <u> https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/solutions/hf002201</u>. The requirement to
      return a defective CRU, if any, will be specified in the instructions shipped
      with a replacement CRU. When return is required: 1) return instructions, a
      prepaid return shipping label, and a container will be included with the
      replacement CRU; and 2) you may be charged for the replacement CRU if the
      Service Provider does not receive the defective CRU from you within thirty (30)
      days of your receipt of the replacement CRU.
    </p>
    <p><b>2. On-site Service </b>
    </p>
    <p>Under On-Site Service, a Service Provider
      will either repair or exchange the product at your location. You must provide a
      suitable working area to allow disassembly and reassembly of the product.
      Some repairs may need to be completed at a service center. If so, the Service
      Provider will send the product to the service center at its expense.
    </p>
    <p><b>3. Courier or Depot Service </b>
    </p>
    <p>Under Courier or Depot Service, your product
      will be repaired or exchanged at a designated service center, with shipping at
      the expense of the Service Provider. You are responsible for disconnecting the
      product and packing it in a shipping container provided to you to return your
      product to a designated service center. A
      courier will pick up your product and deliver it to the designated service
      center. The service center will return the product to you at its
      expense.
    </p>
    <p><b>4. Customer Carry-In Service </b>
    </p>
    <p>Under Customer Carry-In Service, your product
      will be repaired or exchanged after you deliver it to a designated service
      center at your risk and expense. After the product has been repaired or
      exchanged, it will be made available to you for collection. If you fail to
      collect the product, the Service Provider may dispose of the product as it sees
      fit, with no liability to you.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. Mail-In Service </b>
    </p>
    <p>Under Mail-In Service, your product will be
      repaired or exchanged at a designated service center after you deliver it at
      your risk and expense. After the product has been repaired or exchanged, it
      will be returned to you at Lenovo's risk and expense, unless the Service
      Provider specifies otherwise.
    </p>
    <p><b>6. Customer Two-Way Mail-In Service </b>
    </p>
    <p>Under Customer Two-Way Mail-In Service, your
      product will be repaired or exchanged after you deliver it to a designated
      service center at your risk and expense. After the product has been repaired
      or exchanged, it will be made available to you for return shipping at your risk
      and expense. If you fail to arrange return shipment, the Service Provider may
      dispose of the product as it sees fit, with no liability to you.
    </p>
    <p><b> 7. Product Exchange Service </b>
    </p>
    <p>Under Product Exchange Service, Lenovo will
      ship a replacement product to your location. You are responsible for its
      installation and verification of its operation. The replacement product becomes
      your property in exchange for the failed product, which becomes the property of
      Lenovo. You must pack the failed product in the shipping carton in which you
      received the replacement product and return it to Lenovo. Transportation
      charges, both ways, shall be at Lenovo's expense. If you fail to use the
      carton in which the replacement product was received, you may be responsible
      for any damage to the failed product occurring during shipment. You may be
      charged for the replacement product if Lenovo does not receive the failed
      product within thirty (30) days of your receipt of the replacement product.
